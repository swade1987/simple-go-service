# Docker CI/CD tutorial

## 1. Dockerfile and .dockerignore

You will find located in the route directory two files `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore`

These files will need to be editted in order to get the application to run inside a Docker container.

HINT: Remember we only want to the application binary to be inside the container.

HINT: The `.dockerignore` file should include all files and directories you don't want inside of the container.

The blue navigation menu on the right hand side of the page (for the link above) is very informative.
